# Simila

My first 2d game I made several years ago for fun on Python using PyGame library

## Plot

is very simple... You have to find escape from the room, but it's not so obvious:

As you're trying to do it, you meet **Simila** - a girl who stuck in a computer game



She is speaking!             |  Suggests to play a game...

**And tries to kill you!**

**Find out who is she and all about her past!**
After I create the second part....

What happened?!             |  Her notes!

## Installation

All you need is python 3.10 and PyGame installed (use requirements.txt)
Then run main.py

P.S. Thanks to my girlfriend who drew the Simila's pictures. You are an increadible artist. All my designer skills were used to make all the other stuff like icons, dialogs, the person with a question sign on his head. Nevertheless, I am just backend developer :)
